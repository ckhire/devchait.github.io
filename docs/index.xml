      <description>Builder Pattern: Building human objects Let us assume a scenario where in we want to develop a system to store details of all Humans on the earth. Let us start quickly from simpler things without wasting much time in what we are going to do. Here I will be gradually creating a system similar to the marvel universe. Starting from very first entity known to all of us the human-beings on Earth.</description>

      <description>About Me.. I am software enthusiast, intrested in Artificial Intelligence, Neural Network, Big Data, Computer Vision and desiging products. I had implemented good researched ideas/algorithm that had improved the performance of the product. I belive no new technology could be built without the efficient software engineering skills (Design Patterns, Algorithm, Data Structure, Maths and Language knowledge), rest everything is just wrapper or API&amp;rsquo;s making life easy.
This is not whole of me: I love trekking, writing poems, cooking, bike riding.</description>
