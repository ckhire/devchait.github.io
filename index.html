        		<h1>Python and C++ 11 Samples</h1>
				<p>Why another blogging for Python and C++11? Here the focus is on providing step by step samples which will lead towards better software designing. The samples starts with basic requirements and implementation of it. Covering the various aspects of software designing and explaing the real life industrial pratices of maintaining the software. This is an attempt to explain the process of developing, evolving and maintaing the good software. As in software indsutry the requirements gets changed so does the software desing. Here also we will be able to see the example code getting evolved with new requirements. Each blog will try to explain the various paradigm followed to provide the desired functionality. Examples would be explaining how design patterns uses various OOP concepts and the importance of clean code, documentataion and test cases. Starting with very basic sample to developing a complex design we will also explore complex algorithms and the machine learning techniques. Moving more ahead the example will cover writing one's own Neural Network and traversing it as done by other APIS like Pytorch, ONNX, tensorrt. The journey will cover the real life need for Data Science techniques and how to apply it. <br> In very crisp manner here the exaple will cover the journey from good software desing to using it as API for Machine Learning and AI</p>
